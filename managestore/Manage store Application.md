# Manage store Application
## _The Last Markdown Editor, Ever_




The store manages data (with Redux or firebase) about customers, products and purchases.

- The data base has the following initial data:
- 2 products
- 2 customers









The app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [VScode Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [redux] - a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments
- [FireBase] - a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps
