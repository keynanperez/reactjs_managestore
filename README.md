# Manage store Application



application for store management (products, customers and purchases)
Developed using React JS and React-Redux to manage and synchronize the data in the application and Firebase to pull the initial data. The application allows the user to create, delete and update products, change inventory, add, edit and delete customers, make purchases of products and display the total purchases on the site by customer, product or date. Each product purchased is deleted from the stock, added to the general shopping basket and entered into the purchase list of the customer who purchased this product.

The store manages data (with Redux or firebase) about customers, products and purchases.

- The data base has the following initial data:
- 2 products
- 2 customers









The app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [VScode Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [redux] - a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments
- [FireBase] - a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps
